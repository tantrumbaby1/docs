## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Account Curation"
    icon="star"
  >
    **Quality over quantity**: 20-30 high-signal accounts perform better than 200+ noisy ones.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Filter Strategy"
    icon="target"
  >
    **Start simple**: Begin with keyword filters, then add complexity as you learn the patterns.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Notification Fatigue**: Too many notifications can be counterproductive. Start with conservative settings and adjust based on your trading style and schedule.
</Warning>
