## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Account Selection"
    icon="users"
  >
    **Quality over quantity**: Track 10-20 high-quality accounts rather than hundreds of noisy ones.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Filter Usage"
    icon="funnel"
  >
    **Start with 'All'** to understand account patterns, then switch to 'Launched' during active trading.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Rate Limiting**: OneClick respects Twitter's rate limits. If you track too many high-volume accounts, some tweets may be delayed during peak periods.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wifi" title="Connection Problems">
    If the status indicator shows red:
