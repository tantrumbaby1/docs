# OneClick Launching

OneClick Launching is the fastest way to deploy Solana tokens directly from Twitter content. Select text, click launch, and your token goes live in seconds with zero forms or complex setup.

<Card icon="mouse-pointer" title="What is OneClick?">
OneClick transforms any text selection into a live Solana token instantly. Whether it's a tweet, a clever phrase, or a trending meme, you can have it deployed to the blockchain in under 10 seconds.

## How OneClick Works

### The Magic of One-Click

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Text">
    **Highlight any text** on a tweet - token names, memes, trending phrases, or anything that catches your attention.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose OneClick">
    **Click the OneClick button** in the popup that appears. No forms, no configuration needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Instant Deployment">
    **Your token goes live immediately** using your preset SOL amount and platform preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Behind the Scenes

When you hit OneClick, here's what happens in seconds:

1. **Text Processing**: Selected text becomes the token name
2. **Symbol Generation**: AI creates an optimized ticker symbol
3. **Metadata Creation**: Token description and attributes are generated
4. **Blockchain Deployment**: Smart contract deployed to Solana
5. **Initial Purchase**: Your preset SOL amount buys the first tokens
6. **Position Tracking**: Token appears in Launch Zone for management

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Start with very small OneClick amounts (0.01-0.05 SOL) while learning the system. Focus on speed and volume rather than large individual bets. Many small, fast launches often outperform fewer large ones in meme token markets.
